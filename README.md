# Game Engine, RPG and Mystery

This is an updated version of my enchant.js RPG, a step up from the version found in the gladePrologue repository.
<br><br>
After getting feedback on the first game, I included the following updates:
<br>1. Automatic character movement. Instead of using arrow keys or a directional game pad, players can simply click/touch a spot on the screen, and the player icon will move there. Because all game maps had obstacles, I used the A* path algorithm for implementation.
<br>2. I added a very simple turn-based combat system, as well as a status screen with stats and the current goal. This was more for show than actual RPG fighting, as the interface is extemely simple.
<br>3. NPC sprites can appear on the game map.
<br>4. There can be multiple puzzles in a single game. All data - including NPC dialogue and clues - are stored in JSON format, which makes creating new games much simpler.
<br><br>
It can be played online here: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/661204.
<br><br>
However, this is the last game I made using the enchant.js library. The library has not been updated since Sept. 2013, and this caused an older enchant game to break. Also, I began to study JavaScript in more depth since finishing this game.
<br><br>
When I get free time, I plan on switching to Photon.io for my HTML5 games, but that's not urgent.
